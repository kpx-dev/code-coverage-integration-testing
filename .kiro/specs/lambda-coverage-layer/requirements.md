# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Python Lambda layer that provides coverage tracking capabilities for other Lambda functions. The layer will include a coverage package that automatically tracks code coverage, supports health check endpoints, uploads coverage data to S3, and can combine multiple coverage reports into a single consolidated report.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Lambda layer that automatically tracks code coverage for my Lambda functions, so that I can monitor test coverage without modifying my existing Lambda code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Lambda function using the coverage layer is invoked THEN the coverage tracking SHALL be automatically initialized
2. WHEN the Lambda function execution completes THEN the coverage data SHALL be automatically collected
3. WHEN coverage data is collected THEN the system SHALL upload the coverage file to a specified S3 bucket
4. IF the Lambda function fails during execution THEN the coverage data SHALL still be uploaded to S3

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple health check API endpoint in my Lambda function, so that I can verify the function is working correctly and coverage tracking is active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code
2. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN the response SHALL include coverage tracking status
3. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN the response SHALL include layer version information
4. IF coverage tracking is not properly initialized THEN the health check SHALL return appropriate error information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the coverage layer to be packaged as a Lambda layer, so that I can easily reuse it across multiple Lambda functions without duplicating code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the layer is built THEN it SHALL include all necessary Python coverage dependencies
2. WHEN a Lambda function imports the layer THEN the coverage functionality SHALL be available without additional installation
3. WHEN the layer is deployed THEN it SHALL be compatible with Python 3.8+ runtime environments
4. WHEN multiple Lambda functions use the same layer THEN they SHALL each generate separate coverage files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to combine multiple coverage files into a single consolidated report, so that I can see overall test coverage across all my Lambda functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coverage combine function is invoked THEN it SHALL download all coverage files from the specified S3 bucket
2. WHEN coverage files are downloaded THEN the system SHALL merge them into a single coverage report
3. WHEN the combined report is generated THEN it SHALL be uploaded back to S3 with a distinct filename
4. WHEN combining coverage files THEN the system SHALL handle duplicate or overlapping coverage data appropriately
5. IF some coverage files are corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL skip them and log appropriate warnings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable S3 settings for coverage uploads, so that I can control where coverage data is stored and how it's organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the layer is configured THEN it SHALL accept S3 bucket name via environment variables
2. WHEN uploading coverage files THEN the system SHALL use a configurable S3 key prefix
3. WHEN uploading coverage files THEN the system SHALL include timestamp and Lambda function name in the S3 key
4. IF S3 upload fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but not fail the Lambda execution
5. WHEN S3 credentials are not available THEN the system SHALL use the Lambda execution role

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the coverage layer to have minimal performance impact on my Lambda functions, so that coverage tracking doesn't significantly affect execution time or memory usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coverage tracking is enabled THEN the Lambda cold start time SHALL increase by no more than 500ms
2. WHEN coverage data is being collected THEN the memory overhead SHALL be less than 50MB
3. WHEN uploading to S3 THEN the upload SHALL happen asynchronously after the main Lambda logic completes
4. IF the Lambda function times out THEN the coverage upload SHALL be attempted within the remaining execution time
